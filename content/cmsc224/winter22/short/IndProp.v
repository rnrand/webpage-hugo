(** * Inductively Defined Propositions *)

(** In the [Logic] chapter, we looked at several ways of writing
    propositions, including conjunction, disjunction, and existential
    quantification.

    In this chapter, we bring yet another new tool into the mix:
    _inductively defined propositions_.

    To begin, some examples... *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The Collatz Conjecture *)

(** The _Collatz Conjecture_ is a famous open problem in number
    theory.

    Its statement is surprisingly simple.  First, we define a function
    [f] on numbers, as follows: *)

Fixpoint div2 (n : nat) :=
  match n with
    0 => 0
  | 1 => 0
  | S (S n) => S (div2 n)
  end.

Definition f (n : nat) :=
  if even n then div2 n
  else (3 * n) + 1.

(** Next, we look at what happens when we repeatedly apply [f] to some
    given starting number.  For example, [f 12] is [6], and [f 6] is
    [3], so by repeatedly applying [f] we get the sequence [12, 6, 3,
    10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1].

    Similarly, if we start with [19], we get the longer sequence [19,
    58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8,
    4, 2, 1].

    Both of these sequences eventually reach [1].  The question posed
    by Collatz was: Does the sequence starting from _any_ natural
    number eventually reach [1]? *)

(** To formalize this question in Coq, we might try to define a
    recursive _function_ that computes the total number of steps that
    it takes for such a sequence to reach [1]. *)

Fail Fixpoint reaches_1_in (n : nat) :=
  if n =? 1 then 0
  else 1 + reaches_1_in (f n).

(** This definition is rejected by Coq's termination checker, since
    the argument to the recursive call, [f n], is not "obviously
    smaller" than [n].

    Indeed, this isn't just a silly limitation of the termination
    checker.  Functions in Coq are required to be total, and checking
    that this particular function is total would be equivalent to
    settling the Collatz conjecture! *)

(** Fortunately, there is another way to do it: We can express the
    concept "reaches [1] eventually" as an _inductively defined
    property_ of numbers: *)

Inductive reaches_1 : nat -> Prop :=
  | term_done : reaches_1 1
  | term_more (n : nat) : reaches_1 (f n) -> reaches_1 n.

(** The details of such definitions are written will be explained
    below; for the moment, the way to read this one is: "The number
    [1] reaches [1], and any number [n] reaches [1] if [f n] does." *)

(** The Collatz conjecture then states that the sequence beginning
    from _any_ number reaches [1]: *)

Conjecture collatz : forall n, reaches_1 n.

(** If you succeed in proving this conjecture, you've got a bright
    future as a number theorist.  But don't spend too long on it --
    it's been open since 1937! *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Transitive Closure *)

(** A binary _relation_ on a set [X] is a family of propositions
    parameterized by two elements of [X] -- i.e., a proposition about
    pairs of elements of [X].  *)

(** For example, a familiar binary relation on [nat] is [le], the
    less-than-or-equal-to relation. *)

Module LePlayground.

Inductive le : nat -> nat -> Prop :=
  | le_n (n : nat)   : le n n
  | le_S (n m : nat) : le n m -> le n (S m).

End LePlayground.

(** The _transitive closure_ of a relation [R] is the smallest
    relation that contains [R] and that is transitive.  *)

Inductive clos_trans {X: Type} (R: X->X->Prop) : X->X->Prop :=
  | t_step (x y : X) :
      R x y ->
      clos_trans R x y
  | t_trans (x y z : X) :
      clos_trans R x y ->
      clos_trans R y z ->
      clos_trans R x z.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Permutations *)

(** The familiar mathematical concept of _permutation_ also has an
    elegant formulation as an inductive relation.  For simplicity,
    let's focus on permutations of lists with exactly three
    elements. *)

Inductive Perm3 {X : Type} : list X -> list X -> Prop :=
  | perm3_swap12 (a b c : X) :
      Perm3 [a;b;c] [b;a;c]
  | perm3_swap23 (a b c : X) :
      Perm3 [a;b;c] [a;c;b]
  | perm3_trans (l1 l2 l3 : list X) :
      Perm3 l1 l2 -> Perm3 l2 l3 -> Perm3 l1 l3.

(** This definition says:
      - If [l2] can be obtained from [l1] by swapping the first and
        second elements, then [l2] is a permutation of [l1].
      - If [l2] can be obtained from [l1] by swapping the second and
        third elements, then [l2] is a permutation of [l1].
      - If [l2] is a permutation of [l1] and [l3] is a permutation of
        [l2], then [l3] is a permutation of [l1]. *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Evenness (yet again) *)

(** We've already seen two ways of stating a proposition that a number
    [n] is even: We can say

      (1) [even n = true], or

      (2) [exists k, n = double k].

    A third possibility, which we'll use as a running example for the
    rest of this chapter, is to say that [n] is even if we can
    _establish_ its evenness from the following rules:

       - The number [0] is even.
       - If [n] is even, then [S (S n)] is even. *)

(** We can translate the informal definition of evenness from above
    into a formal [Inductive] declaration, where each "way that a
    number can be even" corresponds to a separate constructor: *)

Inductive ev : nat -> Prop :=
  | ev_0                       : ev 0
  | ev_SS (n : nat) (H : ev n) : ev (S (S n)).

(** We can think of this as defining a Coq property [ev : nat ->
    Prop], together with "evidence constructors" [ev_0 : ev 0] and
    [ev_SS : forall n, ev n -> ev (S (S n))]. *)

(** These evidence constructors can be thought of as "primitive
    evidence of evenness", and they can be used just like proven
    theorems.  In particular, we can use Coq's [apply] tactic with the
    constructor names to obtain evidence for [ev] of particular
    numbers... *)

Theorem ev_4 : ev 4.
Proof. apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply ev_0. Qed.

(** ... or we can use function application syntax to combine several
    constructors: *)

Theorem ev_4' : ev 4.
Proof. apply (ev_SS 2 (ev_SS 0 ev_0)). Qed.

(** In this way, we can also prove theorems that have hypotheses
    involving [ev]. *)

Theorem ev_plus4 : forall n, ev n -> ev (4 + n).
Proof.
  intros n. simpl. intros Hn.  apply ev_SS. apply ev_SS. apply Hn.
Qed.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Using Evidence in Proofs *)

(** Besides _constructing_ evidence that numbers are even, we can also
    _destruct_ such evidence, reasoning about how it could have been
    built.

    Introducing [ev] with an [Inductive] declaration tells Coq not
    only that the constructors [ev_0] and [ev_SS] are valid ways to
    build evidence that some number is [ev], but also that these two
    constructors are the _only_ ways to build evidence that numbers
    are [ev]. *)

(** In other words, if someone gives us evidence [E] for the assertion
    [ev n], then we know that [E] must be one of two things:

      - [E] is [ev_0] (and [n] is [O]), or
      - [E] is [ev_SS n' E'] (and [n] is [S (S n')], where [E'] is
        evidence for [ev n']). *)

(** This suggests that it should be possible to do _case
    analysis_ and even _induction_ on evidence of evenness... *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Inversion on Evidence *)

(** We can prove our characterization of evidence for [ev n],
    using [destruct]. *)

Theorem ev_inversion : forall (n : nat),
    ev n ->
    (n = 0) \/ (exists n', n = S (S n') /\ ev n').
Proof.
  intros n E.  destruct E as [ | n' E'] eqn:EE.
  - (* E = ev_0 : ev 0 *)
    left. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E' : ev (S (S n')) *)
    right. exists n'. split. reflexivity. apply E'.
Qed.

(** Facts like this are often called "inversion lemmas" because they
    allow us to "invert" some given information to reason about all
    the different ways it could have been derived.

    Here, there are two ways to prove [ev n], and the inversion lemma
    makes this explicit. *)

(* QUIZ

    Which tactics are needed to prove this goal?

  n : nat
  E : ev n
  F : n = 1
  ======================
  true = false

   (1) [destruct]

   (2) [discriminate]

   (3) both [destruct] and [discriminate]

   (4) These tactics are not sufficient to solve the goal. *)

    (** Similarly, the following theorem can easily be proved using
        [destruct] on evidence. *)

    Theorem ev_minus2 : forall n,
      ev n -> ev (pred (pred n)).
    Proof.
      intros n E.  destruct E as [| n' E'] eqn:EE.
      - (* E = ev_0 *)
        simpl. apply ev_0.
      - (* E = ev_SS n' E' *)
        simpl. apply E'.
    Qed.

    (** *** *)
    (** However, the following simple variation shows that [destruct] can
        sometimes throw away critical information: *)

    Theorem evSS_ev : forall n,
      ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
    Proof.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

  
    (** *** *)
    (** Alternatively, the proof is straightforward using the inversion
        lemma that we proved above. *)

Theorem evSS_ev_inv : forall n, ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n H. apply ev_inversion in H.  destruct H as [H0|H1].
  - discriminate H0.
  - destruct H1 as [n' [Hnm Hev]]. injection Hnm as Heq.
    rewrite Heq. apply Hev.
Qed.

(** Coq provides a handy tactic called [inversion] that does
    the work of our inversion lemma and more besides. *)

Theorem evSS_ev' : forall n,
  ev (S (S n)) -> ev n.
Proof.
  intros n E.  inversion E as [| n' E' Heq].
  (* We are in the [E = ev_SS n' E'] case now. *)
  apply E'.
Qed.

(** We can use [inversion] to re-prove some theorems from
    [Tactics.v].  (Note that [inversion] also works on equality
    propositions.) *)

Theorem inversion_ex1 : forall (n m o : nat),
  [n; m] = [o; o] -> [n] = [m].
Proof.
  intros n m o H. inversion H. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem inversion_ex2 : forall (n : nat),
  S n = O -> 2 + 2 = 5.
Proof.
  intros n contra. inversion contra. Qed.

(** The tactic [inversion] actually works on any [H : P] where
    [P] is defined [Inductive]ly:

      - For each constructor of [P], make a subgoal where [H] is
        constrained by the form of this constructor.

      - Discard contradictory subgoals (such as [ev_0] above).

      - Generate auxiliary equalities (as with [ev_SS] above). *)

(* QUIZ *)

(** Which tactics are needed to prove this goal, in addition to
    [simpl] and [apply]?

  n : nat
  E : ev (n + 2)
  =====================
  ev n

   (1) [inversion]

   (2) [inversion], [discriminate]

   (3) [inversion], [rewrite add_comm]

   (4) [inversion], [rewrite add_comm], [discriminate]

   (5) These tactics are not sufficient to prove the goal.

 *)

(** Let's try to show that our new notion of evenness implies
    our earlier notion (the one based on [double]). *)

Lemma ev_Even_firsttry : forall n,
  ev n -> Even n.
Proof.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Induction on Evidence *)

(** If this story feels familiar, it is no coincidence: We've
    encountered similar problems in the [Induction] chapter, when
    trying to use case analysis to prove results that required
    induction.  And once again the solution is... induction! *)

(** Let's try proving that lemma again: *)

Lemma ev_Even : forall n,
  ev n -> Even n.
Proof.
  intros n E.
  induction E as [|n' E' IH].
  - (* E = ev_0 *)
    unfold Even. exists 0. reflexivity.
  - (* E = ev_SS n' E'
       with IH : Even E' *)
    unfold Even in IH.
    destruct IH as [k Hk].
    rewrite Hk.
    unfold Even. exists (S k). simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** As we will see in later chapters, induction on evidence is a
    recurring technique across many areas -- in particular for
    formalizing the semantics of programming languages. *)


(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Inductive Relations *)

(** Just as a single-argument proposition defines a _property_,
    a two-argument proposition defines a _relation_. *)

Module Playground.

(** Just like properties, relations can be defined inductively.  One
    useful example is the "less than or equal to" relation on numbers
    that we briefly saw above. *)

Inductive le : nat -> nat -> Prop :=
  | le_n (n : nat)                : le n n
  | le_S (n m : nat) (H : le n m) : le n (S m).

Notation "n <= m" := (le n m).

(** Some sanity checks... *)

Theorem test_le1 :
  3 <= 3.
Proof.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

Theorem test_le2 :
  3 <= 6.
Proof.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

Theorem test_le3 :
  (2 <= 1) -> 2 + 2 = 5.
Proof.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

(** The "strictly less than" relation [n < m] can now be defined
    in terms of [le]. *)

Definition lt (n m : nat) := le (S n) m.

Notation "m < n" := (lt m n).

End Playground.

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * A Digression on Notation *)

(** There are several equivalent ways of writing inductive
    types.  We've mostly seen this style... *)

Module bin1.
Inductive bin : Type :=
  | Z
  | B0 (n : bin)
  | B1 (n : bin).
End bin1.

(** ... which omits the result types because they are all bin. *)

(** It is completely equivalent to this... *)
Module bin2.
Inductive bin : Type :=
  | Z : bin
  | B0 (n : bin) : bin
  | B1 (n : bin) : bin.
End bin2.

(** ... where we fill them in, and this... *)

Module bin3.
Inductive bin : Type :=
  | Z : bin
  | B0 : bin -> bin
  | B1 : bin -> bin.
End bin3.

(** ... where we put everything on the right of the colon. *)

(** For inductively defined _propositions_, we need to explicitly give
    the result type for each constructor (because they are not all the
    same), so the first style doesn't make sense, but we can use
    either the second or the third interchangeably. *)


(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Case Study: Improving Reflection *)

(** We've seen that we often need to relate boolean
    computations to statements in [Prop].  However, this can
    result in some tedium in proof scripts.

    Consider: *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In : forall n l,
  filter (fun x => n =? x) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.
  intros n l. induction l as [|m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m :: l' *)
    simpl. destruct (n =? m) eqn:H.
    + (* n =? m = true *)
      intros _. rewrite eqb_eq in H. rewrite H.
      left. reflexivity.
    + (* n =? m = false *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** The first subcase (where [n =? m = true]) is awkward
    because we have to explicitly "switch worlds."

    It would be annoying to have to do this kind of thing all the
    time. *)

(** We can streamline this sort of reasoning by defining an inductive
    proposition that yields a better case-analysis principle for [n =?
    m].  Instead of generating the assumption [(n =? m) = true], which
    usually requires some massaging before we can use it, this
    principle gives us right away the assumption we really need: [n =
    m].

    Following the terminology introduced in [Logic], we call this
    the "reflection principle for equality on numbers," and we say
    that the boolean [n =? m] is _reflected in_ the proposition [n =
    m]. *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
  | ReflectT (H :   P) : reflect P true
  | ReflectF (H : ~ P) : reflect P false.

(** Notice that the only way to produce evidence for [reflect P
    true] is by showing [P] and then using the [ReflectT] constructor.

    If we play this reasoning backwards, it says we can extract
    _evidence_ for [P] from evidence for [reflect P true]. *)

(** To put this observation to work, we first prove that the
    statements [P <-> b = true] and [reflect P b] are indeed
    equivalent.  First, the left-to-right implication: *)

Theorem iff_reflect : forall P b, (P <-> b = true) -> reflect P b.
Proof.
  (* WORK IN CLASS *) Admitted.

(** (The right-to-left implication is left as an exercise.) *)

(** We can think of [reflect] as a kind of variant of the usual "if
    and only if" connective; the advantage of [reflect] is that, by
    destructing a hypothesis or lemma of the form [reflect P b], we
    can perform case analysis on [b] while _at the same time_
    generating appropriate hypothesis in the two branches ([P] in the
    first subgoal and [~ P] in the second). *)

(** Let's use [reflect] to produce a smoother proof of
    [filter_not_empty_In].

    We begin by recasting the [eqb_eq] lemma in terms of [reflect]: *)

Lemma eqbP : forall n m, reflect (n = m) (n =? m).
Proof.
  intros n m. apply iff_reflect. rewrite eqb_eq. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** The proof of [filter_not_empty_In] now goes as follows.  Notice
    how the calls to [destruct] and [rewrite] in the earlier proof of
    this theorem are combined here into a single call to
    [destruct]. *)

Theorem filter_not_empty_In' : forall n l,
  filter (fun x => n =? x) l <> [] ->
  In n l.
Proof.
  intros n l. induction l as [|m l' IHl'].
  - (* l = [] *)
    simpl. intros H. apply H. reflexivity.
  - (* l = m :: l' *)
    simpl. destruct (eqbP n m) as [H | H].
    + (* n = m *)
      intros _. rewrite H. left. reflexivity.
    + (* n <> m *)
      intros H'. right. apply IHl'. apply H'.
Qed.

(** This small example shows reflection giving us a small gain in
    convenience; in larger developments, using [reflect] consistently
    can often lead to noticeably shorter and clearer proof scripts.
    We'll see many more examples in later chapters and in _Programming
    Language Foundations_.

    This use of [reflect] was popularized by _SSReflect_, a Coq
    library that has been used to formalize important results in
    mathematics, including the 4-color theorem and the Feit-Thompson
    theorem.  The name SSReflect stands for _small-scale reflection_,
    i.e., the pervasive use of reflection to simplify small proof
    steps by turning them into boolean computations. *)
